## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in participating in this research project. The following few pages will provide you with further information about the project, so that you can decide if you would like to take part in this research.  
Please take the time to read this information carefully. You may ask questions about anything you don’t understand or want to know more about.  
Your participation is voluntary. If you don’t wish to take part, you don’t have to. If you begin participating, you can also stop at any time.

## What is this research about?
This project aims to conduct a survey on the users and uses of Demographic Projections. The purpose of the survey is to learn about current practices, challenges and needs of demographic projection users in the government, private, and academic sectors. In doing so, we hope to identify gaps between research and practice and support future collaborative efforts to close this gap. The survey findings will be used to prepare a report and academic papers, which will be made available to survey participants in a report and an accompanying academic literature review paper. Both documents will be made available to survey participants.

---

## What will I be asked to do?
Should you agree to participate in the survey you will be asked to: answer a survey about current practices, applications, and needs in demographic forecasting, which should take no more than 15 minutes of your time.

---

## What are the possible benefits?
This project will benefit both practitioners and researchers by deepening their comprehension of the applications of demographic forecasts and the needs of their users. By documenting how demographic projections are used, this project will facilitate the development of targeted research and tools. Such advancements would ensure that researchers are focusing on creating the right tools and resources to support forecast users, and in turn allow demographic forecast users to access projections tailored to their specific needs. In doing so, this project would help identify and bridge gaps between academic, practitioner, and government needs, foster collaboration and enhance the relevance of demographic research for public policy.

---

## What are the possible risks?
There are no known risks associated with this project as the proposed research does not require any activities outside of regular office work.

---

## Do I have to take part?
No. Participation is completely voluntary. You are able to withdraw at any time. However, it will not be possible to withdraw data that has already been collected.

---

## Will I hear about the results of this project?
The results of this project will be published as articles, reports, and other online communications (e.g. blogs). Participants who wish to receive a copy of the survey report and academic paper may request that the authors send them a copy when the project is completed.

---

## What will happen to information about me?
Your survey responses will be kept confidential. While results will generally be published in aggregated form, we may paraphrase individual responses to document specific forecast requirements, ensuring that such paraphrases do not reveal your identity. Data will be securely stored for at least five years or five years beyond the publication of the study's last associated research article.
